# PAM_VFC09JULY2024
PAM is a vehicular fog computing based healthcare proposal that  leverages computation and processing power resource of smart vehicles with existing distributed computing infrastructure. The main focus is minimizing the average latency which is one of needed factor to consider while designing an efficient distributed computing framework.
## Steps involved in Use of MATLAB code and ORIGIN software during validation of PAM by comparing with other benchmark methods via simulation
### Step 1:
Load and initialize the parameters with required values saved in matlab data file "workspace27Sep2023PDFAllmethodsV5.mat"
### Step 2:
Now the expected response latencies by PAM, mCT, MCT, and FCFS need to be confirmed. These response latencies are retrieved using simulating/experimenting the VFC-enabled distributed computing infrastructure. This simulation is done using relevant matlab files which are shown in the following order:
1) AllinOne27Sep2023OwnAprroach.m
2) Allinone10July2024MaxMax_RespLatency_PAM.m
3)
