# PAM_VFC09JULY2024
PAM is a vehicular fog computing based healthcare proposal that  leverages computation and processing power resource of smart vehicles with existing distributed computing infrastructure. The main focus is minimizing the average latency which is one of needed factor to consider while designing an efficient distributed computing framework.
## Steps involved in Use of MATLAB code and ORIGIN software during validation of PAM by comparing with other benchmark methods via simulation
### Step 1:
